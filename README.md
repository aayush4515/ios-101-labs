## 📱 IOS-101 Labs

Welcome to my iOS playground! 🎉
This repo is where I’m keeping all the labs I work on for CodePath’s iOS-101 course. Think of it as my training ground for becoming an iOS dev.

---

### 🚀 Labs so far

- Lab 01 – MarioKart
First taste of Swift + Xcode + iOS Simulator. 🏎️💨
I tinkered with some starter code, added features, and got a simple animated game running.

_(More labs will roll in as I level up!)_

---

### 🎯 What I’m aiming for

- Get comfy writing Swift and building iOS apps
- Make fun + useful apps from scratch
- Learn to code with others (because teamwork makes the dream work ✨)

### 🙌 Shoutout

Big thanks to CodePath for putting together such an awesome intro course. 🚀
